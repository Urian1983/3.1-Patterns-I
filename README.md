# [SPRINT 3][TASK 1]

The code in these exercises corresponds to the solutions for the Sprint 3 exercises of the Java Backend course at the IT Academy. This repository is constantly updated and may contain parallel branches.

## STATEMENTS

### LEVEL 1

**Singleton**

Create a class that replicates the functionality of the 'Undo' command. This class will be used by the Main class, which will allow input of options through the console.

   1. The 'Undo' class must store the last commands entered. It must allow adding or removing commands, as well as listing the most recently entered commands (similar to the 'history' command in Linux).
    
   2. The 'Undo' class must necessarily implement a Singleton pattern.

### LEVEL 2

**Abstract Factory**

Create a small manager for international addresses and phone numbers.

The application should allow adding to the agenda both addresses and international phone numbers.

Taking into account the different formats of different countries, build the agenda, addresses, and phone numbers by implementing an Abstract Factory pattern.
